### How can I use them ? ü§î

#### UI gradients
_This page helps us to create gradient colors, in an easy way for our projects.  let see how it works_:
<!-- ![page's tab](https://github.com/danipv54/HTML-Dominicana/blob/master//basico-html/Capture3.PNG)  -->

```
When We get onto the pages, We will see all of this.
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/css-Tools/uigradients/color2.png) 
```
Here We can copy grandients colors just clicking on. 
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/css-Tools/uigradients/colors1.png) 
Here We see something like a arrow,  if We click on, We can change the gradient for another one, that's defined in this page. let's click. 

![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/css-Tools/uigradients/color3.png)

```
At the top of the page We have many things for example: hamburger menu  
if We click on, It opens a new section to see what combination of gradients are.
```

![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/css-Tools/uigradients/color6.png) 

```
At the top of the page, to be precise at  the right side   There are some icons
You may wonder what are those actions.
```

```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/css-Tools/colorzilla/Capture2.png)

A different between colorzilla  and UI gradient is:  You can save
 Your favorite palette gradient. It's shown in the next image:
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/css-Tools/colorzilla/Capture3.png)

of our gradients and also the size, You may make It to be supported for another browser.

#### Colorable

```
 First look at  Colorable 

 This helps us to use the correct background color and text color.
 Keeping mind: It uses (HEXADECIMAL CSS COLORS).
```

```
 You can modificate text using.

* Hue (degree) 0 to 360
* Saturation 0.01 to 1
* Lightness  0.01 to 1

```
 As the text We can modificate the background.
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/css-Tools/colorable/Capture3.png) 

```
 I changed  the color using hexadecimal css colors. 
```

#### Adobe Color

```
 First look at  Colorable:

```

![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/css-Tools/adobecolor/Capture2.png) 
```

 In my case I select custom:
 
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/css-Tools/adobecolor/Capture3.png) 
```
 If You want to be more precise, You can use this to set Color mode
 in this case is in RGB, but You could select another.
 
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/css-Tools/adobecolor/Capture4.png)
