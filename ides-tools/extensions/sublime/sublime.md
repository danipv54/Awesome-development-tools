### How Can I use them ? ü§î

####  Bracket HighLighter
```
Bracket Highlighter matches a variety of brackets such as: [], (), {}, "", '', 
<tag></tag>, and even custom brackets. Moving forward, I have thrown away all of 
the code and have completely rewritten the entire code base to allow for a more
flexibility, faster, and more feature rich experience.
```

*******************************
####  Emmet
```
Emmet takes the snippets idea to a whole new level: You can type CSS-like expressions that can be
dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on what You type in the abbreviation. Emmet is
developed and optimised for web-developers whose workflow depends on HTML/XML and CSS, but can be 
used with programming languages too.

```

*******************************
####  Live Reload
```
If You hate having to refresh your browser every time You make a change to a local file in order 
to see the results, LiveReload may be the perfect package for you. It enables You to sync local 
files with your favorite browser, so when You make changes and save them, they will display 
instantly.
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img-ext/livereload.png) 
*******************************
####  Todo Review
```
If We tend to leave reminders throughout Our code of tasks We need to work on or come back to, 
We‚Äôll like TodoReview. In a nutshell, the package compiles lists of comments found within Our
projects and outputs them into a new file, like so:

```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img-ext/todo-list1.png) 
```
The default package configuration only recognizes TODO comments. However, you can easily add new 
patterns by modifying the package‚Äôs configuration file:
```

*******************************


####   ColorPicker
```

If you have been accustomed to a code editor that comes with GUI buttons, Sublime Text being a plain
simple code editor with minimal buttons, may frustrate you. 

```

* Windows:```ctrl + shift + c```
* Linux:```ctrl + shift + c```
* OS X:```super  + shift + c```

*******************************
####  Trimmer
```
This plugin helps you remove unnecessary spaces, as well as trailing spaces, which could cause some
errors In JavaScript.
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img-ext/trimmer.gif) 
*******************************
####   Doc Blokr
```
DocBlokr lets you create documentation or annotation for your codes with ease, by parsing 
the functions, parameters, variables, and automatically adding some possible documentation.
