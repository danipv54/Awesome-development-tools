![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/4.png)

```
 Let's create one, first We have to create this structure
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/5.png)

```` 
We must create a prefix, to remeber our snippets. Set any name you want to use as a prefix
````
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/15.png)

````
Then We have to create our snippets body, in this case I create a console.log('hello word'); to test if all is everything is okay. 
````
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/6.png)

````

````
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/7.png)

````

````
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/8.png)

```` 
We have to type the word function between quotation marks:
````
* First step
the dollar sign help us to set the position, after dollar sign add square bracket, inside them there is a number 1, it Referrer to the first position, that is function name, like the image, do not forget to add a open brackt to open the function body and adding a comma, because it is a array
```
"function ${1:functionName}{," 
``` 
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/9.png)

```` 
then We add  quotation marks make some spaces, below there are quotation marks with dollar sign it means: if We use the key tab on our keyboard We will be able to move these positions. 
do not forget to add comma.
````
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/10.png)
