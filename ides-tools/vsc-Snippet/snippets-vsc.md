![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/vsc-Snippet/img/4.PNG)

```
 Let's create one, first We have to create this structure
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/vsc-Snippet/img/5.PNG)

```` 
We must create a prefix, to remeber our snippets. Set any name you want to use as a prefix
````
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/vsc-Snippet/img/15.PNG)

````

````
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/vsc-Snippet/img/6.PNG)

````
Last but not less important, We must set a description, for our snippets, it could be long or short, no matter what always add a descroption
````
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/vsc-Snippet/img/7.PNG)

````

````
* First step
the dollar sign help us to set the position, after dollar sign add square bracket, inside them there is a number 1, it Referrer to the first position, that is function name, like the image, do not forget to add a open brackt to open the function body and adding a comma, because it is a array
```
"function ${1:functionName}{," 
``` 
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/vsc-Snippet/img/9.PNG)

```` 
then We add  quotation marks make some spaces, below there are quotation marks with dollar sign it means: if We use the key tab on our keyboard We will be able to move these positions. 
do not forget to add comma.
````
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/vsc-Snippet/img/10.PNG)
