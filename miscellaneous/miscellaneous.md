#### Neumorphism
```
Neumorphism is an inspiration into the real world.  It‚Äôs a raised shape made from the exact same material as the background.
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/9.png)

```

![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/16.png)

```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/32.png)

```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/33.png)

It will take a few seconds
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/34.png)

It will show us the result: 
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/35.png)

```
We can see the speed of our page, to see if it's going slow or fast
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/36.png)

```
Also google gives us  advice to improve our site
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/37.png)

```
We can ask for a full report to see more about
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/ides-tools/img/38.png)

```
