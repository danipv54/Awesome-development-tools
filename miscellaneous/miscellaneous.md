```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/8.PNG)


#### Neumorphism
```
Neumorphism is an inspiration into the real world.  It‚Äôs a raised shape made from the exact same material as the background.
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/9.PNG)
```
We can modificate by:

*Size
*Radius
*Distance

*Shape
To create any form We want to
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/10.PNG)
```
After We Create our Neumorphism, Just copy the values  
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/11.PNG)

```

```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/15.PNG)

#### Remove BG
```
Maybe some of us Have not used photosho to remove a background image, or We could not find an  png image to be  used in our webapp/mobileapp
```

![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/16.PNG)
```
Forget about using another tool for deleting background, just do it with a click
```

```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/20.gif)

```
Also We can select web view, or any OS We want to...

```
We this pages you can create your own gifs, just updating the video
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/24.PNG)

How Can We test our webapp? Well google has a tool that could help us
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/32.PNG)
```
Let's use our site url, to test, in this case I used google url, click click on the arrow or press enter
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/33.PNG)
```
It will take a few seconds
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/34.PNG)
```
It will show us the result: 
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/35.PNG)

```
We can see the speed of our page, to see if it's going slow or fast
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/36.PNG)

```
Also google gives us  advice to improve our site
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/37.PNG)

```
We can ask for a full report to see more about
```
![page's tab](https://github.com/ionicdominicana/Awesome-development-tools/blob/main/miscellaneous/img/38.PNG)

```
It will request us some information to send the full report to our mail
```
